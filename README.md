Upon launching the game, you will see the game field. In it, you can click on cells to change their state to alive or dead (black cells represent dead, and white cells represent alive). After configuring the setup as desired, press any key on the keyboard, and the game will begin. If you want to start again, you will need to restart the game.

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, and no further input is needed. It is played on a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The game evolves in discrete steps, following a set of rules:

Underpopulation: If a living cell has fewer than two living neighbors, it dies due to isolation.

Stable Population: If a living cell has two or three living neighbors, it survives to the next generation.

Overpopulation: If a living cell has more than three living neighbors, it dies due to overcrowding.

Reproduction: If a dead cell has exactly three living neighbors, it becomes alive due to reproduction.

The game starts with an initial configuration of cells, and these rules are applied iteratively to create new generations. The patterns and behaviors that emerge can be quite complex and interesting.

People have created various patterns in Conway's Game of Life, including gliders, oscillators, and spaceships, which move across the grid in intriguing ways. The Game of Life has applications in computer science, biology, and mathematics as a simple model of cellular automata and complex systems.
